Books Mandala Chrome Extension
A lightweight Chrome extension that detects when you search for a book online and suggests buying it from Books Mandala.

✨ Features
Detects book search queries on supported websites or search bars.

Displays a non-intrusive message encouraging users to buy the book from Books Mandala.

Lightweight and privacy-friendly — no user data is stored or tracked.

How It Works
When you type the name of a book (e.g., "Atomic Habits") into a search box (like Google), the extension identifies the query and shows a popup saying:

"Looking for Atomic Habits? Consider buying it from Books Mandala!"
